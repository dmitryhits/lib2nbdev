    "- Do I want to use `nbdev`'s default Github CI?\n",
    "> `lib2nbdev` can generate a Github Actions CI for you to use specifically designed for nbdev. It will check that the notebooks were cleaned, there's no differences between the notebooks and the exported library, and that your tests all pass\n",
    "- Do I want to use [fastrelease](https://github.com/fastai/fastrelease)\n",
    "> `fastrelease` allows for quick `pip` and `conda` releases, however you need to have a `setup.py` that's similar to [nbdev's](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev_template/blob/master/setup.py). This will require manual adjustments after the library conversion process is over, as all the information needed for the `setup.py` will live in the newly generated `settings.ini` file"
